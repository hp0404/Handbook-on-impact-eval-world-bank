## R Replication Code: [*Handbook on Impact Evaluation Quantitative Methods and Practices*, The World Bank 2010](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2693/520990PUB0EPI1101Official0Use0Only1.pdf)

This repository contains replication code for the exercises in the handbook. The original exercises were coded in Stata, [@johnwoodill](https://github.com/johnwoodill/Rcode-handbook-on-impact-eval-world-bank) have replicated them in R. 
This is my replacation in Python. 


The original Stata files are located in the `Do` folder, `R` and `Python` scripts in their respective folders. 

Feel free to use as you wish.
